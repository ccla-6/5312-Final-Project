Input does not fit into int32_t (>2GB), algorithm will need about `10n` main memory.
It might be more or less depending on the number and length of the individual sequences.
If you are running out of memory, you can try to reduce the memory consumption a bit by inreasing `-S`, e.g., use `-S 20` (up to 64).
Although this will slow down the algorithm to compute the mappability.
