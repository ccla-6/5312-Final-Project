## Data Set Access

Data Stored in SRA PRJNA961733

## Basic Data Set Information

The SRA Run Table is displaying 10 Golden retriever entries when only 8 were utilized in the analysis. Originally, I started by downloading all 10 only to realize that two samples were run on a different type of sequencer. The 8 utilized samples were run on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 while the 2 additional samples were run on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: SRA-Metadata
#| tbl-cap: "Table 1. Shows all of the golden retriever samples included in this dataset."

library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
df=read_csv("SraRunTable.csv")
kable(df)

```

The general statistics for each sample are as follows in the multiQC Report:

The duplication rate here is clearly higher got the two samples that were run in the illumina novaseq 6000.
